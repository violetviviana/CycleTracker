		<p>Hello! This simple web application can help you countdown the days until your next menstrual cycle and menstrual period's conclusion.
		<br> The menstrual cycle is the period lasting around one month in which the female reproductive system releases hormones and prepares the body for pregnancy.
		Menstruation itself is the period in which bleeding occurs, which happens at the beginning of the cycle. 
		This means that the cycle is measured from the start of one bleeding period to the day before the next bleeding period.
